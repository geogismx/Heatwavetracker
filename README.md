# Heat wave tracker: a multi-method, multi-source heat wave measurement toolkit based on Google Earth Engine

## Modeling framework

A multi-characteristic heat wave framework is used to estimate historical and future projected heat waves across Australia. A Google Earth Engine-based toolkit named heat wave tracker (HWT) is developed, which can be used for dynamic visualization, extraction, and processing of complex heat wave events.
